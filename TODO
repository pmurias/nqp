Missing features
    - reasumable exceptions t/nqp/44-try-catch.t

Ops missing for regexes.
We need to write tests (if they don't already exist in t/nqp)

 -  bindpos
 -  callercode
 -  clone
 -  curlexpad
 -  die_s
 -  findmethod
 -  findnotcclass
 -  getattr
 -  getattr_i
 -  getattr_s
 -  getcodename
 -  getlexdyn
 -  iscclass - EASY
 -  isge_i - EASY
 -  isgt_i - EASY
 -  islt_i - EASY
 -  isne_i - EASY
 -  istype
 -  list_i
 -  list_s
 -  nfafromstatelist
 -  nfarunalt
 -  nfarunproto
 -  pop_i
 -  push_i
 -  push_s
 -  sprintf

General stuff that helps all backends
    Write tests (to avoid implementing stuff in crazy ways)
    - nqp::eoffh - EASY
    - nqp::isstr
    - nqp::getmessage
    - nqp::split("",...)  - EASY
    - nqp::printfh in combination with nqp::getstdout(),nqp::getstderr()
    - add a test for nqp::index with three arguments to t/nqp/59-nqpop.t - EASY
    - a test for if cond() -> $value-of-cond {...} - EASY
    - nqp::ifnull

Improving the code quality (which is a bit less atrocious then before ) 
    - Write a nqptidy (or a p6tidy) to make sure the nqp code has a consistent style
    - Tricky and/or confusing bits of code should be identified so that they get commented

Build system
    - make install should install a nqp-js runner.

Portability
    - Get the build system to work on windows (haven't tried that yet)

Write a HACKING file.
